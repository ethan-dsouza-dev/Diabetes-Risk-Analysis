## Question of Interest
What is the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on key diagnostic factors?

The response variable for our analysis is the diabetes outcome (a binary variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes). The explanatory variables include medical predictors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, insulin levels, and the diabetes pedigree function.

### How Data Will Help 
This dataset provides specific medical measurements for 768 patients, each labeled with an outcome for diabetes. By analyzing these measurements and fitting it to a logistic regression model, we can assess how strongly each predictor correlates with the likelihood of diabetes. This enables us to construct a model that predicts the probability of diabetes for a new patient based on their diagnostic measurements. 

### Focus: Prediction and Inference
- *Predict* the probability that a new patient has diabetes, based on the explanatory variables.
- *Infer* which variables are the most significant predictors of diabetes, providing insights into how specific health factors relate to diabetes risk.
